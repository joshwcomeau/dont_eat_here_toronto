Don't Eat Here
==============

A simple Chrome extension that will add restaurant inspection scores to yelp pages for Toronto restaurants.

When browsing Yelp, an icon will be added to the restaurant page that features the most recent Toronto City Food Inspection result and score. Find out whether that highly-reviewed pita place has rats in the kitchen.

Back-end will be a simple Rails API.
